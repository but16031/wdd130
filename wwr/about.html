            <h2 class="russo-one-regular">History</h2>
            <p>Rapid Adventures began as a small group of passionate river enthusiasts in 2010, exploring the untamed rapids of North America’s most scenic rivers. Founded by two childhood friends with a shared love for the outdoors, the company started with just a single raft, guiding small groups of friends down local rivers. Over time, word spread about their exceptional knowledge, safety, and heart-pounding expeditions.

                Now, Rapid Adventures has grown into a full-scale operation, offering diverse rafting packages ranging from beginner-friendly floats to expert-level expeditions across the continent. Staying true to their roots, they remain a family-oriented company that believes in adventure, sustainability, and fostering a love for the wilderness.</p>
